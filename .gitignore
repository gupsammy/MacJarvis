# Electron-Store data
# Default location is OS-specific, often in AppData/Application Support
# Add the specific file name if known, e.g., config.json
# Or, if you configured a specific path, add that path.
# Since the default path is outside the project, this might not be strictly necessary,
# but adding common names is good practice.
*.json # Might be too broad, consider more specific name like config.json if applicable
*.db # Common suffix for simple databases electron-store might use

# OS generated files
.DS_Store
